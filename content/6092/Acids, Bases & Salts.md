# Acids
An **acid** is a substance which dissociates in an aqueous solution to give **hydrogen ions**. All acids contain $\ce{H^+}$ ions.
Pure acid exists as simple covalent molecules. Acid molecules **dissociate** in the presence of water. An acid only exhibits acidic properties when dissolved in water, as the presence of hydrogen ions cause the acidity.
Acids can be grouped into:
- inorganic acids
    - hydrochloric acid, $\ce{HCl}$
    - nitric acid, $\ce{HNO_3}$
    - sulfuric acid, $\ce{H_2SO_4}$
    - phosphoric acid, $\ce{H_3PO_4}$
    - carbonic acid, $\ce{H_2CO_3}$
- organic acids
    - ethanoic acid, $\ce{CH_3COOH}$, in vinegar
    - citric acid, $\ce{C_6H_8O_7}$, in citrus fruits and vegetables
    - ascorbic acid, $\ce{C_6H_8O_6}$, vitamin C
    - tartaric acid, $\ce{C_4H_6O_6}$, in grapes and baking powder
    - lactic acid, $\ce{C_3H_6O_3}$, in sour milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, produced by muscles during exercise
    - tannic acid, $\ce{C_76H_52O_46}$, in tea and oak leaves
    - formic/methanoic acid, $\ce{HCOOH}$, in red ants, bee stingers, textile dyeing
## Acid basicity
The **basicity of an acid** is the maximum number of hydrogen ions produced by one molecule of the acid when the acid molecules dissociates in water:
- monobasic acids
    - hydrochloric acid, $\ce{HCl} (aq) → \ce{H^+}(aq) + \ce{Cl^-}(aq)$
    - nitric acid, $\ce{HNO_3}(aq) → \ce{H^+}(aq) + \ce{NO_3^-}(aq)$
    - ethanoic acid, $\ce{CH_3COOH}(aq) \leftrightarrow \ce{H^+}(aq) + \ce{CH_3COO^-}(aq)$
- dibasic acids
    - sulfuric acid, $\ce{H_2SO_4}(aq) → \ce{2H^+}(aq) + \ce{SO_4^2-}(aq)$
    - carbonic acid, $\ce{H_2CO_3}(aq) \leftrightarrow \ce{2H^+}(aq) + \ce{CO_3^2-}(aq)$
- tribasic acids
    - phosphoric acid, $\ce{H_3PO_4}(aq) \leftrightarrow \ce{3H^+}(aq) + \ce{PO_4^3-}(aq)$
## Acid strength
The **strength of an acid** depends on the extent of dissociation of the acid molecules in an aqueous solution.
A strong acid **completely dissociates** in water to give hydrogen ions, whereas a weak acid **partially dissociates** in water to given hydrogen ions.

|Strong acids|Weak acids|
|---|---|
|Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid|Ethanoic acid, carbonic acid|
|All acid molecules form ions|Most acid molecules remain unchanged, few ions are formed|
|Complete dissociation|Partial dissociation|

## Concentration

The ****concentration of a solution**** is a measure of how much ************solute************ has ******************dissolved****************** in $1\text{dm}^3$ of the solution.

$\text{mol/dm}^3$ is the unit for concentration.

## Properties of acids

Acids are ********sour********. They have a pH less than 7, can conduct electricity, and turn ******************************************blue litmus paper red******************************************.

Acids react with metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series (excluding copper, silver, gold and platinum) to form salt and hydrogen gas.

$$ \text{acid + metal} → \text{salt} + \ce{H_2} $$

Acids react with metal carbonate to form salt, water and carbon dioxide.

$$ \text{acid + metal (hydrogen) carbonate} → \text{salt} + \ce{H_2O} + \ce{CO_2} $$

Acids react with bases to form salt and water only.

$$ \text{acid + base} → \text{salt} + \ce{H_2O} $$

## Uses of acids

Acids are used in real-world contexts for different purposes:

- manufacture of fertilisers
    - sulfuric acid & nitric acid act as starting materials for the production of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, which are active ingredients in fertilisers
- battery acid in cars
    - dilute sulfuric acid reacts with lead plates & lead(IV) oxide plates in batteries to release electricity
- pickling of metals
    - hydrochloric acid removes rust, a.k.a iron(III) oxide, to form iron(III) chloride
- food production
    - phosphoric acid makes food sour, carbonic acid makes drinks fizzy, ethanoic acid acts as a food preservative and flavour enhancer

# Bases and alkalis

A ********base******** is a substance that reacts with acid to form salt and water. Bases are usually metal oxides/hydroxides.

An **********alkali********** is a base that dissociates in water to produce $\ce{OH^-}$ ions. Alkalis are usually metal hydroxide solutions (except aqueous ammonia).

## Alkali strength

A **************************strong alkali************************** completely dissociates in water to give hydroxide ions, whereas a **********************weak alkali********************** partially dissociates in water to give hydroxide ions.

Aqueous ammonia, $\ce{NH_3}$, is a weak alkali.

## Properties of bases and alkalis

Alkalis are ************bitter and soapy************. They have a pH greater than 7, can conduct electricity, and turn ****************red litmus paper blue****************.

Bases react with acids to form **************************************salt and water only************************************** in a neutralisation reaction.

$$ \text{base + acid} \rightarrow \text{salt} + \ce{H_2O} $$

********************On warming********************, alkalis react with ammonium salts to form **********salt, ammonia gas, and water**********.

$$ \text{alkali + ammonium salt} → \text{salt} + \ce{NH_3} + \ce{H_2O} $$

Alkalis react with metal ions to produce ****************************insoluble metal hydroxides****************************, which appears as precipitate, through a precipitation reaction.

$$ \text{solution w/ metal ion + alkali} → \text{insoluble metal hydroxide (precipitate) + salt} $$

## Uses of bases

Bases are used to:

- neutralise acids
    - toothpaste neutralises acids on our teeth produced by bacteria when it feeds on sugars in our food
    - patients suffering from gastric issues due to excess gastric juices in the stomach are given magnesium hydroxide which neutralises the acidic gastric juice
    - lime (calcium oxide) is used to neutralise acidic soil
- dissolve dirt and grease
    - soap and detergents are mild alkalis
    - floor cleaners often contain sodium hydroxide
    - ammonia is used in liquids for cleaning glass windows

# Indicators and pH

## pH scale

****pH**** is a measure of acidity or alkalinity in an aqueous solution, specifically the **concentration of hydrogen ions** in the aqueous solution.

The pH scale is numbered between 0 to 14.

- pH < 7 is acidic
- pH = 7 is neutral
- pH > 7 is alkaline

## Indicators

An ******************indicator****************** is an organic compound which changes in colour in accordance with the pH of the solution.

|Indicator|Acidic|Alkaline|pH threshold for change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Litmus|red|blue|7|
|Phenolphthalein|colourless|pink|9/10|
|Methyl orange|red|yellow|4|
|Screened methyl orange|purple|green|4|
|Bromothymol blue|yellow|blue|7|

### Universal indicator

The universal indicator is a pH indicator that exhibits colour changes over a wide range of pH values.

It is red for strong acids (pH < 3), orange/yellow for weak acids (pH 3-6), green for neutral solutions (pH 7), blue for weak alkalis (pH 8-11), and indigo/violet for strong alkalis (pH > 11).

## pH meter

A ****************pH meter**************** is an electrical method of measuring the pH of a solution. It consists of a pH electrode connected to a meter. The pH electrode is dipped into a solution and the pH value is shown on the meter.

pH meters are more reliable and accurate than indicators, and can be used in data logging to record rapid changes in pH.

# Oxides

An **********oxide********** is a compound of oxygen with another element.

There are four types of oxides — (1) acidic, (2) basic, (3), amphoteric, and (4) neutral.

## Acidic oxides

**************************Acidic oxides************************** are oxides of non-metals, such as $\ce{CO_2}, \ce{SO_2}, \ce{SO_3}$.

They usually dissolve and **************react with water************** to ************************produce acids************************.

They ****react with alkalis**** to ************************************************produce salt and water only************************************************.

## Basic oxides

************************Basic oxides************************ are oxides of metals, such as $\ce{Na_2O}, \ce{MgO}, \ce{CuO}$.

If soluble, they dissolve and react with water to ********produce alkalis********.

They **********************************react with acids********************************** to **********************************produce salt and water only**********************************.

## Amphoteric oxides

********************Amphoteric oxides******************** are $\ce{ZnO}, \ce{Al_2O_3},$ and $\ce{PbO}$.

They do ******not****** dissolve in water, and can behave as ******************************acidic oxides or basic oxides******************************, reacting with ********both******** alkalis and acids to produce salt and water.

## Neutral oxides

**Neutral oxides** are oxides of non-metals, such as $\ce{H_2O}, \ce{CO}, \ce{NO}$.

They do not dissolve in water, and do not react with acids or alkalis.

# Salts

A ********salt******** is formed when the **********************hydrogen ions********************** of an acid is partially or completely replaced by a **********************************metal or ammonium********************************** ion.

## Water of crystallisation

Many salts have water molecules loosely associated with them. These water molecules are known as **water of crystallisation**.

Salts that contain water of crystallisation are called **hydrated salts**, whereas salts that do not are called **anhydrous salts**.

Hydrated salts are not obtainable via method of evaporation to dryness, as water of crystallisation can be lost by heating.

## Preparation of salts

There are three methods used in the preparation of salts.

|Method|Precipitation|Reaction of acid|Titration|
|---|---|---|---|
|Solubility of salt|insoluble|soluble (not Group 1 or ammonium)|soluble (Group 1 or ammonium)|
|Reaction|precipitation|acid + insoluble carbonate/base/metal|acid + alkali/soluble carbonate|
|State of reactants|solution + solution|solution + solid|solution + solution|
|Salt obtained as…|precipitate|solution|solution|

### Precipitation

**************************Precipitation************************** is a chemical reaction where an ****************************************************************insoluble product (precipitate)**************************************************************** is formed when two aqueous solutions are mixed. It involves mixing ******************************************two aqueous solutions****************************************** to obtain an insoluble salt.

$$ \ce{AB (aq)} + \ce{XY (aq)} → \ce{AY (s)} + \ce{XB (aq)} $$

$$ \text{solution containing cation + solution containing anion} → \text{precipitate + solution} $$

## Reaction of acid

This method involves the reaction of an acid with excess insoluble carbonate, base or moderately reactive metal.

For ****************************************insoluble carbonates****************************************,

$$ \text{acid + insoluble carbonate} → \text{soluble salt} + \ce{H_2O} + \ce{CO_2} $$

For ******************************insoluble bases******************************,

$$ \text{acid + insoluble base} → \text{soluble salt} + \ce{H_2O} $$

For **************metals**************,

$$ \text{acid + metal} → \text{soluble salt} + \ce{H_2} $$

## Titration

Salts composed with Group 1 metals or ammonium are highly explosive when reacted with acids. Hence, ******titration****** is used to prepare such salts.

To do so, an indicator is needed to show exactly how much alkali or soluble carbonate is required to neutralise the acid.

For **********************************acids and alkalis**********************************,

$$ \text{acid + alkali} → \text{soluble salt} + \ce{H_2O} $$

For **************************acids and soluble carbonates**************************,

$$ \text{acid + soluble carbonate} → \text{soluble salt} + \ce{H_2O} + \ce{CO_2} $$

The ******titration curve****** shows the equivalence point (at which the acid or base is completely neutralised):

- equivalence point = pH 7 for acids and bases of equal strength
- equivalence point < pH 7 for acids stronger than bases
- equivalence point > pH 7 for bases stronger than acids

## Precautions

Insoluble reactant is **********************unsuitable********************** for preparing insoluble salt

- insoluble reactant reacts with acid to form insoluble salt, which coats onto the surface of the insoluble reactant, preventing further reaction between the reactant and acid

Solution is heated

- to speed up the reaction

Excess reactant is used

- to ensure that all acid has completely reacted with the solid reactant, ensuring that the resulting solution is not contaminated with acid

Stirring is necessary

- to mix the reactants well for complete reaction

Hot solution is cooled because

- as temperature decreases, solubility of salt decreases, hence salt will crystallise from the solution

Crystals must be dried between sheets of filter paper instead of being evaporated to dryness

- upon heating, hydrated salts may lose water of crystallisation and become anhydrous or decompose
