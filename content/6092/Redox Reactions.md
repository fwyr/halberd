# Oxygen
Oxidation is the **gain of oxygen by a substance**, whereas reduction is the **loss of oxygen by a substance**.
Consider the following reaction.
$$ 
\ce{CuO(s) + C(s) -> Cu(s) + CO(g)} 
$$
Here,
- $\ce{C}$ is **oxidised** because $\ce{C}$ **gains** oxygen to form $\ce{CO}$.
- $\ce{CuO}$ is **reduced** because $\ce{CuO}$ **loses** oxygen to form $\ce{Cu}$.
An **oxidising agent** is a substance that oxidises another substance while itself is being reduced. 
A **reducing agent** is a substance that reduces another substance while itself is being oxidised.
Here,
- $\ce{CuO}$ is the **oxidising** **agent** because $\ce{CuO}$ loses oxygen to $\ce{C}$ and oxidises $\ce{C}$ to $\ce{CO}$.
- $\ce{C}$ is the **reducing** **agent** because $\ce{C}$ gains oxygen from $\ce{CuO}$ and reduces $\ce{CuO}$ to $\ce{Cu}$.

# Hydrogen
Oxidation is the **loss of hydrogen** by a substance, whereas reduction is the **gain of hydrogen** by a substance.
Consider the following reaction.
$$ 
\ce{Br2(g) + N2H2(g) -> N2(g) + 2HBr(g)} 
$$
Here,
- $\ce{N2H2}$ is **oxidised** because $\ce{N2H2}$ **loses** hydrogen to form $\ce{N2}$.
- $\ce{Br2}$ is **reduced** because $\ce{Br2}$ **gains** hydrogen to form $\ce{HBr}$.
- $\ce{Br2}$ is the **oxidising agent** because $\ce{Br2}$ gains hydrogen from $\ce{N2H2}$ and oxidises $\ce{N2H2}$ to $\ce{N2}$.
- $\ce{N2H2}$ is the **reducing agent** because $\ce{N2H2}$ loses hydrogen to $\ce{Br2}$ and reduces $\ce{Br2}$ to $\ce{HBr}$.

# Electrons
Oxidation is the **loss of electrons** by a substance, whereas reduction is the **gain of electrons** by a substance.
Consider the following reaction.
$$ 

\ce{2Na(s) + Cl2(g) -> 2NaCl(s)} $$
The separate equations showing which substance gains electrons and which substances loses electrons are known as **half equations**.
Here,
- $\ce{Na}$ is oxidised because $\ce{Na}$ loses electrons to form $\ce{Na+}$.
    - half equation: $\ce{Na→Na+ + e-}$
- $\ce{Cl2}$ is reduced because $\ce{Cl_2}$ gains electrons to form $\ce{Cl-}$.
    - half equation: $\ce{Cl_2 + e- →2Cl-}$
- $\ce{Na}$ is the reducing agent because $\ce{Na}$ loses electrons to form $\ce{Cl_2}$ and reduces $\ce{Cl_2}$ to $\ce{Cl-}$.
- $\ce{Cl_2}$ is the oxidising agent because $\ce{Cl_2}$ gains electrons from $\ce{Na}$ and oxidises $\ce{Na}$ to $\ce{Na+}$.

# Oxidation state
The **oxidation state** or **oxidation number** is the **charge** an atom would have if it existed as an ion.
An atom in a covalent substance can be assigned an oxidation state by assuming that the substance is ionic.
## Rules
There are several rules governing the assignment of an oxidation state.
1. oxidation state of an **element** = 0
    - e.g. oxidation state of sodium in $\ce{Na}$ = 0
    - e.g. oxidation state of chlorine in $\ce{Cl_2}$ = 0
2. oxidation state of an element in a **simple ion** = charge on the ion
    - e.g. oxidation state of lithium in $\ce{Li+}$ = +1
    - e.g. oxidation state of oxygen in $\ce{O^{2-}}$ = -2
3. sum of oxidation states in a **compound** = 0
    - e.g. sum of oxidation states of all elements in $\ce{NaCl}$ = 0
        - (+1) + (-1) = 0
4. sum of oxidation states in a **polyatomic ion** = charge on the ion
    - e.g. sum of oxidation states of all elements in $\ce{CO3^{2-}}$ = -2
        - (+4) + 3(-2) = -2
5. oxidation state of some elements is **fixed**
    - oxidation state of **all Group 1 metals** = +1
    - oxidation state of **all Group 2 metals** = +2
    - oxidation state of **hydrogen***:
        - in covalent substances = +1
        - in ionic substances (as hydrides) = -1
    - oxidation state of **oxygen**:
        - in most compounds = -2
        - in peroxides = -1
6. oxidation states of some elements can **vary in different compounds**

## Electronegativity

************************************************************Electronegativity************************************************************ refers to the ability of an atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself in a covalent bond.

- Electronegativity ************************************increases across a period************************************.
- Electronegativity ********************************************decreases down a group********************************************.

In covalent compounds, the negative oxidation state is assigned to the **************************************************most electronegative atom**************************************************.

## Oxidation and reduction
Oxidation is the **increase in oxidation state** of an element in a substance during a reaction, whereas reduction is the **decrease in oxidation state** of an element in a substance during a reaction. 
Consider the following reaction.
$$ 
\ce{Mg + CuO -> MgO + Cu} 
$$
Here,
- $\ce{Mg}$ is oxidised because the oxidation state of magnesium increases from 0 in $\ce{Mg}$ to +2 in $\ce{MgO}$.
- $\ce{CuO}$ is reduced because the oxidation state of copper decreases from +2 in $\ce{CuO}$ to 0 in $\ce{Cu}$.
- $\ce{Mg}$ is the reducing agent.
- $\ce{CuO}$ is the oxidising agent.
