# Relative mass
## Relative atomic mass
The **relative atomic mass** ($A_r$) of an element is the average mass of one atom of the element with compared with $\frac{1}{12}$ the mass of one atom of carbon-12.

$$ 
A_r = \frac{\text{average mass of one atom of the element}}{\text{mass of an atom of carbon-12}} 
$$

## Relative molecular/formula mass
The **relative molecular/formula mass** ($M_r$) of a molecule is the average mass of one atom of the molecule/formula with compared with $\frac{1}{12}$ the mass of one atom of carbon-12.
$$ 
M_r = \frac{\text{average mass of one molecule of an element/compound}}{\text{mass of an atom of carbon-12}}
$$

# Composition of mass
## Composition of compounds by mass
The percentage of an element in a compound by mass can be calculated as follows.
$$ 
\% = \frac{\text{no. of atoms of element in formula} \times A_r  \text{ of element}}{M_r \text{ of the compound}} \times 100\% 
$$
## Calculation of mass in compound
The mass of an element in a sample of a compound can be calculated as follows.
$$ 
m = \frac{\text{no. of atoms of element in formula} \times A_r \text{ of element}}{M_r \text{ of the compound}} \times \text{mass of sample} 
$$

# Moles
## Avogadro’s number
The **mole** is the S.I. unit for the amount of substance. **One mole of a substance** contains the same number of particles as the number of atoms in 12g of carbon-12, also known as **Avogadro’s number**.
In other words, $1 \text{ mol} = 6.02 \times 10^{23}$.
$$ 
\text{number of moles} = \frac{\text{number of particles}}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} 
$$
## Molar mass
**Molar mass** is the mass of **one mole of any substance**.
The molar mass is the **relative atomic/molecular/formula mass** of the substance in grams per mole.
$$
\text{number of moles} = \frac{\text{mass of substance in (g)}}{\text{molar mass of substance (g/mol)}} 
$$

## Molar volume of gases
**Avogadro's Law** states that equal **volumes** of all gases, under the same **temperature** and **pressure** contain the same number of particles.
**The molar volume** of gas is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas. At room conditions, this value is **24.0dm**$^3$.
$$ 
\text{number of moles} = \frac{\text{volume of gas}}{\text{molar volume of gas}} 
$$

# Empirical & molecular formula
## Determining empirical formula
The **empirical** formula of a compound can be found from the **masses** of elements that are combined together.
To determine the empirical formula of a substance,
1. Write down the **mass** of each element (g)
2. Write down the **molar mass** of each element (g/mol)
3. Divide each mass by its molar mass to obtain the **number of moles** of each element (mol)
4. Divide each no. of moles by the smallest number in step 3 to obtain the **mole ratio**
## Calculating molecular formula
The **molecular formula** can be calculated from the empirical formula and relative molecular mass.
Let the molecular formula of a substance be $A_xB_xC_{2x}$.
$x$ can be found by dividing the relative molecular mass of the substance by the relative formula mass of the empirical formula.

# Calculations from equations
A balanced chemical equation provides information on:
- reactants used
- products formed
- **ratio** of the **number of moles** of reactants and products, which can be expressed in
    - mass
    - volume
    - number of moles

# Calculations for volumes for reacting gases
According to Avogadro's Law, the volume of a gas in a reaction is **proportional** to the number of moles of the gas.
For reactions involving gaseous reactants and products, the **mole ratio** is the same as the **volume ratio** of the gases (provided all volumes are measured at the **same temperature and pressure**).

---
# Limiting reactants
The **limiting reactant** is the reactant that is completely **used up** in a reaction and it **limits** the amount of products formed.
The amount of a product formed in a reaction is always determined by the amount of the limiting reactant.
To determine the limiting reactant:
1. Write the balanced chemical equation.
2. Find the number of moles given for each reactant.
3. Find out which reactant is in excess and which reactant is the limiting reactant by finding whether the number of moles given of a substance is more or less than the number of moles needed of a substance.
    - If no. of moles given > no. of moles needed, substance is in excess
    - If no. of moles given < no. of moles needed, substance is the limiting reactant
4. The no. of moles of the limiting reactant determines the number of moles of products.

# Concentration of solutions
The concentration of a solution provides information about the **amount of solute** in a unit volume of a solution.
There are two ways of measuring the concentration:
$$ 
\text{concentration in g/dm}^3 = \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{volume of solution (dm}^3 \text{)}} 
$$
$$ 
\text{concentration in mol/dm}^3 = \frac{\text{concentration (g/dm}^3\text{)}}{\text{molar mass of solute (g/mol)}} 
$$

# Percentage yield & purity
## Percentage yield
The amount of a product formed in a reaction is known as the yield. The **theoretical yield** is the amount of product **calculated from the equation**. The **experimental yield** is the amount of product that is **actually obtained in the experiment**.
$$ 
\text{percentage yield} = \frac{\text{experimental yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100\% 
$$

## Percentage purity
Sometimes, substances are not pure and the percentage purity needs to be calculated.
$$ 
\text{percentage purity} = \frac{\text{mass of pure substance}}{\text{mas of impure substance}} \times 100\% 
$$
