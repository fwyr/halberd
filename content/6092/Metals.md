# Metals
**Metals** are elements which **lose electrons** to form **positive ions** (except hydrogen).
Metal ions are **closely packed** together in a regular 3-dimensional pattern or lattice, with the valence electrons from each atom **free to move** at random in the space between the metal ions, forming a **‘sea’ of valence electrons**.
A metallic bond is the **electrostatic force of attraction** between the positive metal ions and the ‘sea’ of free-moving valence electrons.

# Metals vs. non-metals
## Physical properties

|Physical properties|Metals|Non-metals|
|---|---|---|
|Appearance|Shiny (lustrous), can be polished|Dull, cannot be polished|
|Melting and boiling points|Usually solids at room temperature, high melting and boiling points (except for mercury)|Usually liquids/gases at room temperature, low melting and boiling points (except for diamond, silicon, graphite)|
|Heat and electrical conductivity|Good conductors|Poor conductors (except for graphite)|
|Density|Relatively high densities|Relatively low densities|
|Malleability|Malleable (can be bent and beaten into different shapes)|Brittle (breaks without bending and stretching)|
|Ductility|Ductile (can be stretched and pulled into wires)|Not ductile|

### Malleability & ductility
Atoms in pure metals are packed in layers in an orderly manner.
Atoms in pure metals are of the same size. This allows the **orderly layers** of the **same-sized atoms** to **slide over each other easily** when a force is applied. Hence, pure metals are **ductile and malleable**.
### High melting & boiling points
Atoms in a metal are packed tightly in layers and are held together by strong metallic bonds.
A **large amount of energy** is needed to overcome the **strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between positive metal ions and the ‘sea’ of free-moving electrons.
### Good conductor of electricity
The presence of the **‘sea’ of free-moving valence electrons** helps to conduct electricity.

# Alloys
>[!info] Alloys
>An alloy is a **mixture** of a metal with one or more other **elements**.

Some alloys have special properties not found in individual metals, such as resistance to corrosion.
Pure metals are not commonly used as they are soft and many of them may corrode easily by reacting with oxygen and water.
## Strength of alloys
Most metals are used in the form of alloys because they are **harder** and stronger than **pure** metals.
This is because in alloys, atoms of added element have a **different size** from atoms in the pure metal. This disrupts the **orderly** arrangement of atoms in pure metals. Hence, it is much **harder** for the atoms to slide over each other when a force is applied.
## Structure of alloys
In an alloy, metal atoms are mixed with atoms of other elements.

# Reaction with cold water & steam
>[!info] Reaction with Water
>When a metal reacts with cold water or steam, the following reactions are produced.
>$$ 
>\ce{\text{reactive metal} + H2O(l) -> \text{aqueous metal hydroxide} + H2} 
>$$
>$$ 
>\ce{\text{heated moderately reactive metal} + H2O(g) -> \text{insoluble metal oxide} + H2} 
>$$

Upon reaction with cold water or steam, each metal causes a unique reaction.
- Potassium, $\ce{K}$
    - $\ce{2K(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts very violently in cold water, highly exothermic.
    - Potassium darts rapidly on the surface of water and melts. Fizzing occurs.
    - Hydrogen ignites instantly. The metal is also set on fire, with sparks and a lilac flame.
- Sodium, $\ce{Na}$
    - $\ce{2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) →2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts violently in cold water.
    - Sodium darts rapidly on the surface of water and melts into silverly ball. Fizzing occurs.
    - Sodium may catch fire and burn with yellow flame.
    - If indicator is added:
        - Green universal indicator turns violet, red litmus paper turns blue
- Calcium, $\ce{Ca}$
    - $\ce{Ca(s) + H2O(l) →Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts readily with cold water.
    - Rapid effervescence seen, colourless and odourless gas evolved.
    - Colourless solution soon turns cloudy as calcium hydroxide is only slightly soluble in water
- Magnesium, $\ce{Mg}$
    - $\ce{Mg(s) + H2O(g) →MgO(s) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts very slowly with cold water.

    - Silvery/grey magnesium solid turns white and bright white glow is produced during the reaction.
- Aluminium, $\ce{Al}$
    - $\ce{4Al(s) + 3O2(g) + 2Al2O3(s)}$
    - Aluminium metal does not seem to react with water or steam.
    - This is because aluminium is covered with a thin layer of non-porous aluminium oxide which adheres strongly to the metal and protects it from reacting.
- Zinc, $\ce{Zn}$
    - $\ce{Zn(s) + H2O(g) →ZnO(s) + H2(g)}$
    - Hot zinc reacts readily with steam. Does not react with cold water.
    - Grey zinc solid slowly becomes coated with a yellow solid which becomes white when cold.
- Iron, $\ce{Fe}$
    - $\ce{3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) →Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)}$
    - Red hot iron reacts slowly with steam. Does not react with cold water.
    - Grey iron solid turns red hot on heating and black when cooled.

**Lead**, **copper**, **silver**, and gold have **no reaction** with cold water or steam.

# Reaction with dilute acids
>[!info] Reaction with Dilute Acids
>Metals **below hydrogen** in the reactivity series do not react with acids to produce hydrogen gas. 
>Metals **above hydrogen** in the reactivity series can displace hydrogen gas from dilute acids.
>$$ 
>\ce{\text{reactive metal} + \text{dilute }HCl -> \text{salt} + H2(g)} 
>$$

- Potassium, $\ce{K}$
    - $\ce{2K(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2KCl(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts explosively.
- Sodium, $\ce{Na}$
    - $\ce{2Na(s) + 2HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts explosively.
- Calcium, $\ce{Ca}$
    - $\ce{Ca(s) + 2HCl(aq) → CaCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts violently.
    - Very rapid effervescence seen, colourless and odourless gas evolved.
- Magnesium, $\ce{Mg}$
    - $\ce{Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts rapidly.
    - Rapid effervescence seen, colourless and odourless gas evolved.
- Aluminium, $\ce{Al}$
    - Aluminium does not seem to react at first as it is covered by a layer of non-porous aluminium oxide which adheres strongly to the metal.
    - However, hydrochloric acid will react with aluminium oxide.
        - $\ce{Al2O3(s) + 6HCl(aq) → 2AlCl3(aq) + 3H2O(l)}$
    - Once the oxide layer is reacted away, aluminium reacts rapidly with acid.
        - $\ce{2Al(s) + 6HCl(aq) → 2AlCl3(aq) + 3H2(g)}$
- Zinc, $\ce{Zn}$
    - $\ce{Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts moderately fast.
    - Steady effervescence seen, colourless and odourless gas evolved.
- Iron, $\ce{Fe}$
    - $\ce{Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) → FeCl2(aq) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts slowly.
    - Slow effervescence seen, colourless and odourless gas evolved.
    - Pale green iron(II) chloride solution and hydrogen gas are formed.
- Lead, $\ce{Pb}$
    - $\ce{Pb(s) + 2HCl(aq) → PbCl2(s) + H2(g)}$
    - Reacts very slowly and reaction stops before completion.
    - Insoluble lead(II) chloride salt formed will coat onto the surface of the lead metal and prevent further reaction between the acid and the lead metal.

**Copper**, **silver**, and **gold** produce no reaction with dilute hydrochloric acid as they are below hydrogen in the reactivity series.
## Notes
Most metals react with dilute nitric acid. However, products formed depend on the concentration of the acid and the nature of the metals.
$$ 
\ce{Zn(s) + 4HNO3(aq) -> Zn(NO3)2(aq) + 2NO2(g) + 2H2O(l)} 
$$
Dilute nitric acid can oxidise un-reactive metals such as copper.
$$ 
\ce{3Cu(s) + 8HNO3(aq) -> 3Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2NO(g) + 4H2O(l)} 
$$

# Displacement of metals
## Metal salt solutions
>[!info] Metallic Displacement of Salts
>A **more reactive** metal will **displace** the **less reactive** metal from its salt solution.

A more reactive metal **loses electrons more readily** to form positive ions.
Ions of the less reactive metal **accept the electrons** from the more reactive metal to form the metal atoms.
Hence, a more reactive metal will displace the less reactive metal from its salt solution.
The **further apart** the two metals in the reactivity series, the **easier/faster** the displacement reaction.
Such displacement reactions are often accompanied by
- change in **appearance in metal**
- change in **colour of salt solution**
- heat change

For example,

$$ 
\ce{Fe(s) + CuSO4(aq) -> Cu(s) + FeSO4(aq)} 
$$

Observations:
1. The iron nail is coated with a reddish brown solid.
2. The blue copper(II) sulfate solution turns pale green after some time.

Explanation:
- Iron, being more **reactive** than copper, **loses electrons more readily** than copper.
- Iron displaces copper from blue copper(II) sulfate solution. Reddish-brown copper solid and pale green iron(II) sulfate solution are formed.
## Metal oxides
>[!info] Thermit Reactions
> A **more reactive** metal will **displace** a **less reactive** metal from the metal oxide.

If a more reactive metal is thoroughly mixed with the **oxide** of a less reactive metal (both in powder form), and **strongly heated**, the more reactive metal will displace the less reactive metal from the oxide.
This type of reaction is called a **thermit reaction**, because of the great amount of heat released.
For example,
$$ 
\ce{2Al(s) + Fe2O3(s) -> Al2O3(s) + 2Fe(l)} 
$$
Observation:
- Reaction is very **exothermic** with a lot of **heat** and **light** energy given out.

Explanation:
- Aluminium, being more **reactive** than iron, **loses electrons** more readily than iron.
- Aluminium **displaces iron** from iron(III) oxide. Molten iron and aluminium oxide are formed.

# Reduction of metal oxides
## Carbon

>[!info] Reduction by Carbon 
>Carbon can remove oxygen from the oxides of some metals and **reduce** the oxides to metals.
>$$ 
>\ce{\text{metal oxide} + C -> metal + CO2} 
>$$

The **more reactive** the metal, the **harder it is for carbon to take oxygen away** from its oxides.
Oxides of metals **above zinc** in the reactivity series are **not reduced** by carbon.
For example,
$$ 
\ce{2CuO(s) + C(s) -> 2Cu(s) + CO2(g)} 
$$

## Hydrogen
>[!info] Reduction by Hydrogen 
>Hydrogen can also be used for reducing some metal oxides to their metals.
>$$ 
>\ce{metal oxide + H2(g) -> metal + H2O} 
>$$

The **more reactive** the metal, the **harder it is for hydrogen to take oxygen away** from its oxides.
Oxides of metals **above iron** in the reactivity series are **not reduced** by hydrogen.
For example,
$$ 
\ce{CuO(s) + H2(g) -> Cu(s) + H2O(g)}
$$
**Black** copper(II) oxide solid turns **red-brown/pink**.

# Heating metal carbonates
>[!info] Thermal Decomposition of Metal Carbonates
>Most carbonates decompose when heated, producing metal oxide and carbon dioxide.
>$$ 
>\ce{metal carbonate -> metal oxide + CO2} 
>$$

The **more reactive the metal**, the **more thermally stable the carbonate**, in other words, the metal carbonate is **less easily decomposed**.
Higher temperatures are then needed to decompose the compound of a more reactive metal.
- Potassium & sodium carbonate
    - Not decomposed by heat
- Calcium carbonate
    - Very strong heating
- Magnesium, zinc, iron, lead carbonate
    - Moderate heating
- Copper carbonate
    - Gentle heating
    - Green $\ce{CuCO3}$ forms black $\ce{CuO}$
- Silver carbonate
    - Gentle heating
    - $\ce{2Ag2CO3 → 4Ag + O2 + 2CO2}$
    - Silver carbonate decomposes to give silver, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. Hence, silver carbonate must be kept in a cool place.

# Extraction of metals
Most metals are found in the ground as **ores**, which are **compounds** of metals mixed with large amounts of impurities. Extracting metal from ores involves getting rid of the impurities, and obtaining metal from the mineral.
There are two main methods for extracting metals — (1) **electrolysis** and (2) **reduction of metal oxide using reducing agents**.

|Metal|Method of extraction|
|---|---|
|$\ce{K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al}$|Very reactive metals with strong chemical bonds. Electrolysis is used to break down the molten ionic compounds to obtain the metals.||
|$\ce{Zn, Fe, Sn, Pb, Cu, Ag}$|Moderately reactive metals, usually found as oxides. Usually extracted by reducing their oxides with carbon.||
|$\ce{Au, Pt}$|Unreactive metals, found naturally uncombined in the ground as elements.|
## Extraction of iron
The main ore of iron is **hematite**, containing mainly $\ce{Fe2O3}$ mixed with impurities such as sand and clay (mainly silicon dioxide), phosphorus and sulfur.
Iron is extracted from hematite in the blast furnace. There are **3 raw materials** introduced into the top of the furnace:
1. hematite — **iron(III) oxide**, $\ce{Fe2O3}$
2. coke — **carbon**, $\ce{C}$
3. limestone — **calcium carbonate**, $\ce{CaCO3}$

**Hot air** is pushed into the furnace near the bottom.
The following chemical reactions take place:
- carbon dioxide production
    - coke burns in air to produce carbon dioxide and a lot of heat (which heats the furnace)
    - $\ce{C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g), \Delta{H} = -ve}$
    - heat produced helps to **decompose** the limestone to produce carbon dioxide and calcium oxide (quicklime)
    - $\ce{CaCO3(s) → CO2(g) + CaO(s)}$, to obtain calcium oxide which removes impurities later on
- carbon monoxide production
    - as carbon dioxide rises up the furnace, it reacts with more coke to produce carbon monoxide
    - $\ce{CO2(g) + C(s) → 2CO(g), \Delta{H} = +ve}$
- reduction of hematite
    - carbon monoxide reacts with iron(III) oxide to produce iron
    - $\ce{3CO(g) + Fe2O3(s) → 2Fe(l) + 3CO2(g)}$
    - iron(III) oxide is reduced as iron(III) oxide loses oxygen
    - carbon monoxide acts as a **reducing agent** as carbon monoxide gains oxygen from iron(III) oxide and reduces iron(III) oxide to iron
    - iron formed is **molten** and runs to the bottom of the furnace
- removal of impurities
    - main impurities in iron ores are sand and clay which consist primarily of silicon dioxide, $\ce{SiO2}$, which is an acidic oxide
    - limestone added first breaks down in presence of heat to form **calcium oxide**, a basic oxide
    - calcium oxide is able to react with silicon dioxide to produce molten **slag** which is mainly **calcium silicate**
    - $\ce{CaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l)}$
    - the slag floats on top of the molten iron, and they are tapped off separately from the blast furnace
    - iron extracted from the blast furnace is known as pig iron
- removal of waste gases
    - hot waste gases containing mainly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and unreacted carbon monoxide escape through the top of the furnace

|Removing oxygen from iron(III) oxide|Removing impurities in iron ore|
|---|---|
|Combustion reaction (exothermic) <br> $\ce{C(s) + O2(g) → CO2(g)}$|Decomposition (endothermic) <br> $\ce{CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)}$||
|Formation of $\ce{CO}$ using excess coke <br> $\ce{CO2(g) + C(s) → 2CO(g)}$|Neutralisation <br> $\ce{CaO(s) + SiO2(s) → CaSiO3(l)}$||
|Reduction of $\ce{Fe2O3}$ <br> $\ce{Fe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) → 2Fe(l) + 3CO2(g)}$||

## Types & uses of steel
Pig iron obtained from blast furnaces is not very useful as it still contains impurities, making the iron weak and brittle. Most of these impurities need to be removed before iron is converted to steel.
Steel is an alloy of **iron** and **carbon** will small amounts of other elements. Steel is stronger and tougher than iron. Different types of steel with different physical properties are achieved by varying carbon concentration and adding different elements.

|Type of steel|Mild steel (low carbon steel)|High carbon steel|Stainless steel|
|---|---|---|---|
|Composition|Iron, 0.25% carbon|Iron, 0.45-1.5% carbon|Iron, carbon, chromium, and nickel|
|Special properties|Hard, strong and malleable|Strong but brittle|Durable and highly resistant to corrosion|
|Uses|Car bodies and machinery|Tips of drill bits, knives, hammers, chisels, cutting tools|Cutlery, surgical, and dental instruments|

# Rusting
Rust is a **reddish-brown substance** that forms slowly on the surface of an object made of iron when the object is exposed to air and moisture for some time. It consists mainly of **hydrated iron(III) oxide**.

>[!info] Rusting 
>Rusting is the slow oxidation of iron to form hydrated iron(III) oxide.
>$$ 
>\ce{4Fe + 3O2 + 2xH2O -> 2Fe2O3 xH2O} 
>$$

Both **oxygen** and **water** are needed for rusting occur. The presence of $\ce{NaCl}$ (alongside acidic substances, like $\ce{SO2}$ and $\ce{CO2}$) **increases** the speed of rusting.
## Rust prevention
Rust is brittle and flaky. When iron corrodes, rusted surface flakes away, producing new surfaces to corrode, eventually leading to the entire metal rusting and flaking away.
There are three main methods of rust prevention:
1. using a protective layer
    - coating the iron surface with a protective layer (e.g. paint, grease) that acts as a barrier to air and water
2. using a sacrificial metal
    - protects iron against rusting by using a more reactive metal
3. using alloys
    - use of rust-resistant alloys
### Protective layer
For **painting**, **oiling & greasing**, and **plastic coating**, if the protective layer is removed, rusting occurs as oxygen and water can reach the surface of iron and steel.
For **tin plating**, if the tin layer is damaged or scratched, oxygen and water can reach the iron, causing it to rust quickly. This is because iron, being more reactive than tin, loses electrons more readily than tin.
For **chrome plating**, iron can be coated with chromium using electrolysis, giving an attractive appearance as well as rust protection. Chromium is resistant to corrosion as it has a protective coating of hard and non-porous chromium(III) oxide, $\ce{Cr2O3}$ on its surface.
### Sacrificial metal
For **zinc plating (galvanising)**, zinc has a fairly low melting point, easily applied by dipping iron or steel in molten zinc. If the zinc layer is damaged, iron will not rust. Zinc, being more reactive than iron, loses electrons more readily than iron. Hence, zinc will corrode in place of iron by sacrificial protection.
For **attaching blocks of zinc to ship hulls**, sea water and air can reach the steel but zinc being more reactive than iron in steel, loses electrons more readily than iron. Zinc will corrode in place of iron and protect iron from rusting.
For **attaching blocks of magnesium to underground steel pipes**, magnesium, being more reactive than iron in steel pipes, loses electrons more readily than iron. Hence, magnesium will corrode in place of iron and protect the iron from rusting.
### Rust-resistant alloys
For **using stainless steel**, stainless steel is an alloy of iron and carbon with quite a large mount of chromium and nickel.

# Recycling
Metals are finite resources and have limited reserves. It is important to make metals last longer by either recycling them or replacing the metals with other materials.
Recycling metals means reusing them by collecting and melting down scrap metal to make blocks of clean fresh metal which can be then used to make new objects.
## Advantages of recycling
There are multiple advantages to recycling metals.
1. Natural resource conservation
    - Recycling metals allows us to conserve the finite metal resources on the Earth and make them last longer.
2. Energy conservation
    - Recycling scrap metal requires significantly less energy than manufacturing new metals from their metal ores.
3. Environmental benefits
    - Substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through practice of recycling metals as less fossil fuels are burned.
    - Recycling metals cuts down on mining. Mining of metal ores generates a large amount of waste materials. If the waste is not disposed carefully, the waste may leach into soil and nearby water bodies, polluting land and water. Mined land cannot support plant and animal life.
    - Recycling metals reduces waste disposal problems.
## Issues of recycling
When recycling metals, issues may arise.
1. Economic issues
    - Recycling metals can be **extremely expensive**.
    - For cheap metals, recycling can be more costly than extracting the metals. This is because of the cost incurred in sorting, transporting, and cleaning the scrap metal.
2. Social issues
    - It takes time and effort for communities to adopt recycling as a lifestyle, so it might not be immediately effective.
3. Environmental issues
    - Recycling can cause pollution problems.
