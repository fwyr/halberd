# Periodic table
The Periodic Table is a method of arranging elements in order of **increasing atomic number**.

![[periodictable.png]]

A **Group** is a vertical column of elements, with a total of **18 groups**. Notable groups include Group 1 (alkali metals), Group 2 (alkaline earth metals), Group 17 (halogens), and Group 18 (noble gases).
A **period** is a horizontal row of elements, with a total of **7 periods**.
Elements in the Periodic Table are divided by the ‘staircase’ along $\ce{B}, \ce{Si}$, etc. into **metals** and **non-metals**.
- left of staircase → metals
- right of staircase → non-metals
- along staircase → metalloids, exhibiting properties of **both** metals and non-metals
## Groups
Group numbers **represent valence electrons**. Elements in Group 1 – 2 have the same number of valence electrons as their group number, whereas groups 13 – 18 have valence electrons equal to the group number minus 10.
Elements in the same group has **similar chemical properties**.
- form ions of the same charge
- form compounds with similar formulae
- form the same no. of bonds when they share electrons

Down a group,
- no. of protons **increases**
- atomic radii of nucleus **increases**
    - no. of electron shells increases
## Periods
Period numbers represent the **number of electron shells**.
Across a period,
- no. of protons **increases**
- metallic character **decreases**
- nature of oxides changes from **basic** to **acidic**

# Alkali metals
Elements in Group 1 are called **alkali metals**, as they react with water to produce an alkali solution and hydrogen gas.

$$
\ce{Group 1 metal + H_2O -> aqueous metal hydroxide + H2} 
$$

Down Group 1,
- melting point **decreases**
- density **increases**
- reactivity **increases**

**Physical properties** of alkali metals include
1. good conductors of electricity (due to giant metallic structure)
2. soft and can be easily cut with a knife
3. shiny, silvery solids when cut
4. low density
5. low melting points

**Chemical properties** of alkali metals include
1. metal atoms lose their one valence electron readily (oxidation) to form ions with 1+ charge
2. behaves as **reducing agents**
3. reacts vigorously with oxygen to produce **metal oxides**
4. reacts vigorously with water to produce alkali solution and hydrogen
    - Group 1 metals are stored in oil to prevent metals from reacting with water and oxygen in the air and become tarnished
5. reacts vigorously and burns brightly when heated with chlorine gas to produce white solids of metal chlorides
6. oxides are basic in nature
7. carbonates are soluble in water & thermally stable

# Halogens
Group 17 elements are called **halogens** as they react with most metals to form **salts**.
They have **7 valence electrons** and form ions with charge **1-**. They exist as diatomic molecules.
## Physical properties of halogens
Halogens are **coloured**, and become progressively **darker** down the Group.
- fluorine — pale-yellow gas
- chlorine — greenish-yellow gas, pale-yellow aqueous solution
- bromine — reddish-brown gas, orange aqueous solution, reddish-brown liquid
- iodine — purple gas, brown aqueous solution, purple when dissolved in organic solvent, black solid

**Low** melting and boiling points due to simple molecular structure.
**Non-conductors** of electricity, due to no free-moving electrons or ions available.
Generally **insoluble in water**.
## Trends down Group 17
Melting and boiling points **increase**.
Reactivity **decreases**.
Colour becomes **progressively darker**.
## Chemical properties of halogens
Halogen atoms gain 1 electron readily (reduction) to form ions with 1- charge.
Behaves as **oxidising agents**.
Undergoes displacement reactions — more reactive halogens will displace a less reactive halogen from its aqueous salt solution.

# Noble gases
Elements in Group 18 are called **noble gases**.
Helium has 2 valence electrons (stable duplet configuration) while the rest of the elements in the group have 8 valence electrons (stable octet configuration).
## Properties of noble gases
**Low** melting and boiling points.
**Insoluble** in water.
Chemically **inert**.
## Uses of noble gases

|Noble gases|Uses|
|---|---|
|Helium|Fill weather balloons and airships|
|Neon|Making of advertisement lights|
|Argon|Fill light bulbs to provide inert environment to protect the tungsten filament from reacting with oxygen under high temperatures|

# Transition metals
**Transition metals** are elements in Group 3 to Group 12.
Most transition metals are silvery or grey in colour, except copper (reddish-brown) and gold.
## Properties of transition metals
**Good** conductor of electricity.
**High** melting and boiling points due to large energy needed to overcome strong electrostatic forces of attraction between metal cations and ‘sea’ of free-moving electrons.
**High** density.
Exhibit variable **oxidation states**.
Form **coloured compounds**.
Transition metals and their compounds are good **catalysts**.
