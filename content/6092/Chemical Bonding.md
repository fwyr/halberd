# Ionic bonding
Ionic bonds
- are **strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between **oppositely-charged ions**;
- occur after the transfer of electrons between atoms and the formation of ions.
Most metals and non-metals form ionic bonds, with the cation from the metal and the anion from the non-metal.
## Ionic structures
**Giant ionic structures** consists of a continuously repeating 3-dimensional lattice of positive and negative ions, held in fixed positions by **strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely-charged ions.**
## Physical properties
Ionic compounds have the following physical properties:
- high melting and boiling points
    - a **large** amount of energy is required to **overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction** between **oppositely-charged ions**
    - the bigger the charge of the ions, the stronger the electrostatic forces of attraction, and the higher the melting and boiling points
- conducts electricity in molten/aqueous state
    - when in solid state, the oppositely-charged ions are held in fixed positions by **strong electrostatic forces of attraction**, therefore ions are **not free-moving** and cannot conduct electricity
    - when in molten/aqueous state, the strong electrostatic FOA between oppositely-charged ions have been overcome, therefore ions are **free-moving** and can conduct electricity
- soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents

# Covalent bonding
Covalent bonds form between non-metal atoms by the sharing of electrons.
The driving force behind the sharing of electrons is that all non-metal atoms want to achieve a stable noble gas electronic configuration.
The electrons can be shared between atoms of the same kind (in elements) such as $\ce{H_2}$ or $\ce{Cl_2}$, or between atoms of different kinds such as $\ce{HCl}, \ce{NH_3}, \ce{H_2O}$ and $\ce{CH_4}$.
## Covalent structures
Covalent compounds are held together by
- intramolecular forces (between atoms), usually **strong** (Van der Waals force)
- intermolecular forces (between molecules), usually **weak**
Covalent structures can be categorised into:
- simple molecular structures, held together by **weak intermolecular forces**
- giant molecular structures, held together by **strong covalent bonds**
## Physical properties
**Simple covalent compounds** have the following physical properties:
- low melting and boiling points
    - very **little** energy is needed to **overcome the weak intermolecular forces of attraction** within the compound
- do not conduct electricity
    - **no free-moving valence electrons**
- insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents
**Giant covalent compounds** have the following physical properties:
- high melting and boiling points
    - a **large** amount of energy is needed to **break the strong covalent bonds** between atoms
- do not conduct electricity (**except for graphite**)
    - **no free-moving electrons or ions** as all valence electrons are used for bonding, except for graphite
    - there are free-moving electrons in graphite as each carbon atom is only bonded to 3 other atoms instead of 4
- hard
    - all atoms are held by **strong covalent bonds** throughout the structure
- **only graphite** is soft and slippery
    - graphite has a giant molecular layered structure, with layers of atoms **held together by weak intermolecular forces of attraction**, therefore they can **slide over one another** when a force is applied

# Metallic bonding
Metal atoms are closely packed together to form a **giant metallic lattice structure**.
A **metallic bond** refers to the **strong electrostatic forces** of attraction between the **positive metal ions** and the **'sea' of delocalised valence electrons**. Metallic bonding occurs only in metals and exists throughout the entire structure
Metallic bonds are formed as metals have a high tendency to lose their valence electrons in order to achieve a stable electronic configuration. These electrons are given out and form a 'sea' of delocalised, free-moving valence electrons around the positive metal ions.
## Physical properties
Metals have the following physical properties:
- high melting and boiling points
    - a **large** amount of energy is needed to **overcome the strong electrostatic forces** of attraction between the **positive metal ions** and the **'sea' of free-moving valence electrons**
- conduct electricity
    - **'sea' of free-moving valence electrons** present to conduct electricity
- ductile and malleable
    - when a force is applied, the layers of ions can easily **slide over each other** without breaking the metallic bond
- insoluble in water and organic solvent

# Electronegativity
Electronegativity refers to the ability of an atom to **attract a shared pair of electrons** towards itself in a covalent bond.
Electronegativity **increases across a period** and **decreases down a group**.
## Non-polar covalent bond
If the two atoms involved in a covalent bond are either the same or have similar electronegativity, a **non-polar covalent bond** forms, meaning that the two atoms have **equal pull** on the shared pair of electrons.
## Polar covalent bond
If the two atoms involved in covalent bonding have different electronegativity values, the pair of shared electrons are **not equally shared** between the two atoms and a **polar covalent bond** forms.
In a polar covalent bond, the more electronegative atom acquires a **partial negative change** (denoted by $\delta^-$) and the less electronegative atom acquires a **partial positive charge** (denoted by $\delta^+$).
