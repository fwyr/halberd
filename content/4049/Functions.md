# Functions & relations
A **relation** is an association between elements of two sets.
A **function** is a relation that associates every element of a set (known as the domain) with one unique element of another set (known as the co-domain).
Functions are generally denoted by letters such as $f, g, h, p$, etc.
The value of a function $f$ at an element $x$, denoted by $f(x)$, is called the **image** of $x$ under $f$.
To define a function, the **rule** and **domain** must be present.
For example,
- $f:x\mapsto2x, x\in\mathbb{R}$
- $g:x\mapsto\frac{1}{x+2}, x\in\mathbb{R}, x\neq2$

# Graphs, domains & ranges
The **domain** set is the set of $x$ values where the function $f$ is defined for. The domain is a set of values on the $x$-axis, highlighting the smallest and the largest $x$ values.
The **range** set is the set of $y$ values that corresponds to the domain set. The range set is the set of values on the $y$-axis that corresponds to the part of the graph of $y = f(x)$ drawn for the domain, highlighting the smallest and the largest $y$ values.
In a restricted domain, there are **end points** to the corresponding graph. A **shaded** circle is used to represent the point whose $x$ value is **inclusive**. An **unshaded** circle is used to represent the point whose $x$ value is **non-inclusive**.
To determine the range for a given domain of a function, one has to first [[(03) Graphs of Functions (I)|sketch the graph]] of the function in the **given domain**. The inequality signs for the range of a function will depend on whether the extreme values of $y$ in the graph corresponding to a point is included or not included in the domain of $f(x)$.

# Inverse functions
Given a function $f$ that maps $x$ to $y$, the **inverse** of $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}$, is a function that maps $y$ to $x$.
The inverse of $f$ exists if and only if $f$ is a one-to-one function.
The domain of $f^{-1}$ is the same as the range of $f$, and vice versa.
$$ 
\begin{align*} D_{f^{-1}} &= R_f \\ D_f &= R_{f^{-1}} \end{align*} 
$$
To determine the inverse function $f^{-1}$ from the function $f$,
1. Let $y = f(x)$.
2. Make $x$ the subject of the equation.
3. $f^{-1}:y\mapsto\cdots$
4. $f^{-1}:x\mapsto\cdots$

$y = f^{-1}(x)$ is a reflection of $y = f(x)$ along the line $y = x$.
If $f^{-1}(y) = x$, then $f(x) = y$.
