# Inequalities
An **inequality** is a mathematical statement which compares two expressions using one of the symbols $>$, $<$, $\geq$, or $\leq$. The expressions involved can be linear or quadratic.
If $x$, $y$, and $k$ $\in \mathbb{R}$, and $x > y$, then
- $x \pm k > y \pm k$ (Addition Property)
- $kx > ky$ if $k > 0$ or $kx < ky$ if $k < 0$ (Multiplication Property)
- $x > k$ if $y > k$ (Transitivity Property)
## Solving quadratic inequalities
For [[(02) Quadratic Expressions & Equations|quadratic]] inequalities that **can be easily factored**, simply sketch the graph of the equation, showing clearly the $x$-intercepts, and identify the range of values of $x$ based on the question.
For quadratic inequalities that **cannot be easily factored**, let the expression be equal to 0. Then, make use of the quadratic formula to find the possible values of $x$ and sketch the graph of the equation. Identify the range of values of $x$ based on the equation.

# Usage of discriminant
The **discriminant** of a quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c$ is defined as $b^2-4ac$.
If the equation has
- **two** real and **distinct** roots
	- $b^{2}-4ac > 0$
- **two** real and **equal** roots
	- $b^{2}-4ac=0$
- **no** real roots
	- $b^{2}-4ac<0$
This property should typically be stated. 
For example, since $ax^2+bx+c$ has distinct real roots, discriminant $> 0$.
## Line-curve intersection
When determining the coordinates of the point of intersection, use simultaneous equations to solve the equation of the line and the equation of the curve.
There are three possible scenarios when a straight line intersects a quadratic curve:
1. the straight line intersects the curve at 2 points
2. the straight line touches the curve at 1 point (the line is tangential to the curve)
3. the straight line does not intersect the curve, forming 0 points of intersection

| No. of points | Nature of roots             | Discriminant    |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| 2             | Two real and distinct roots | $b^2 - 4ac > 0$ |
| 1             | Two real and equal roots    | $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ |
| 0             | No real roots               | $b^2 - 4ac < 0$ |

# Always positive or negative
When $ax^2 + bx +c$ is **always positive**,
- $ax^2+bx+c > 0$ for all real values of $x$
- the curve opens upwards and lies entirely above the $x$-axis, without any $x$-intercepts
- $ax^2 +bx +c = 0$ has no real roots, discriminant $< 0$, coefficient of $x^2 > 0$
When $ax^2+bx+c$ is **always negative**,
- $ax^2+bx+c<0$ for all real values of $x$
- the curve opens downwards and lies entirely below the $x$-axis, without any $x$-intercepts
- $ax^2+bx+c=0$ has no real roots, discriminant $< 0$, coefficient of $x^2 < 0$

# Prove or show
For questions involving **proving** or **showing** something, assumptions about the discriminant cannot be made.
Instead, workings must be carried out to show that the discriminant expression will turn out to be what the question requires.
