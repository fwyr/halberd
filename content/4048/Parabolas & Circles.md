# y² = x
The graph of $y^2 = kx$ is
- **symmetrical** about the $x$-axis
- passes through the origin
- defined for $x> 0$ if $k > 0$ or $x < 0$ if $k < 0$

Such graphs are obtained by reflecting graphs of $y=ax^2$ along the line $y = x$.
## Intersections with lines
Consider a curve $y^2 = kx$ that intersects a line $y = kx$. Given these two equations, $y^2$ can be represented as a [[(02) Quadratic Expressions & Equations|quadratic expression]] of form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
Let the discriminant of $y^2$, $b^2 - 4ac$, be $D$.
- If $D > 0$, there are 2 real and distinct roots, hence there are 2 points of intersection.
- If $D = 0$, there are 2 real and identical roots, hence there is 1 point of intersection.
- If $D<0$, there are no real roots, hence there are 0 points of intersection.

# Equation of a circle
The equation of a circle can be written in two forms.
## Standard form
The **standard form** of the equation of a circle is
$$
(x - a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2
$$
where $(a, b)$ is the **centre** and $r$ is the **radius**.
## General form
The **general form** of the equation of a circle is
$$
x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0
$$
where $(-g, -f)$, is the **centre** and $r = \sqrt{f^2+g^2-c}$ is the **radius**.
## Cross-representation between forms
To change the equation of a circle from standard to general form, **expand** the two perfect squares and simplify like terms together.
To change the equation of a circle from general to standard form, [[(02) Quadratic Expressions & Equations#Completing the square|complete the squares]] for $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms and move the resulting constant terms to the right-hand side of the equation.

# Intersections of lines & circles
Given a line $y = mx + b$ and a circle $x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0$, their points of intersection may be obtained by solving the two equations simultaneously.
- If discriminant $> 0$, 2 real & distinct roots → 2 points of intersection
- If discriminant $= 0$, 2 real & equal roots → 1 point of intersection
- If discriminant $< 0$, no real roots → no points of intersection

# Geometric properties of circles
There are some important [[(07) Geometrical Properties of Circles|geometric properties involving circles]] that apply to this topic:
- The perpendicular bisector of any chord of a circle will pass through the centre of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent of the circle at the point of contact.
- Tangents to a circle from an external point are equal in length.
- The line joining the external point to the centre of the circle bisects the angle between the tangents from this external point.
