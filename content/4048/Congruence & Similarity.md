# Congruence
If two triangles are **congruent**, then their corresponding sides and angles are equal.
The mathematical notation to show that $\triangle{ABC}$ is congruent to $\triangle{DEF}$ is $\triangle{ABC}\equiv\triangle{DEF}$.
There are multiple tests that can be used to mathematically prove that two triangles are congruent:
1. **side-side-side** (SSS)
    - 3 sides of one triangle are equal to the corresponding 3 sides of the other triangle
2. **side-angle-side** (SAS)
    - 2 sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding 2 sides and included angle of the other triangle
3. **angle-angle-side** (AAS/SAA)
    - 2 angles and a side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding 2 angles and a side of the other triangle
4. **right-angle-hypotenuse-side** (RHS)
    - the hypotenuse and 1 side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and the corresponding side of another right-angled triangle
    - this is a special case, as side-side-angle (SSA/ASS) is generally not a congruence test

# Similarity
Similar figures have the **same shape** but they **differ in sizes**.
The tests for similar triangles are:
1. **angle-angle**
    - 2 angles of one triangle are equal to the corresponding angles of the other triangle
2. **side-side-side**
    - all ratios of corresponding sides are equal
3. **side-angle-side**
    - 2 ratios of the corresponding sides and 1 pair of included angles are equal

# Ratio of similar figures
When two plane figures are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of the lengths of a pair of corresponding sides.
$$
\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \left(\frac{l_1}{l_2}\right)^2 
$$
When two solids are similar, the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of the ratio of the lengths of a pair of corresponding sides.
$$ 
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \left(\frac{l_1}{l_2}\right)^3 
$$
