# Oblique triangles
Oblique triangles are triangles that do not contain a right angle.

By convention, the vertices of a triangle are labelled with capital letters. Each side of the triangle is labelled with the lowercase letter that corresponds to the angle opposite it.

## Area of oblique triangles

The area of an oblique triangle can be found using the following formula.

$$
\text{area of } \triangle{ABC} = \frac{1}{2}bc\sin A
$$

This formula can be used to calculate the area of a triangle if **two sides and an included angle** are provided.

# Sine rule
The **sine rule** states that for any $\triangle ABC$,

$$
\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b}=\frac{\sin C}{c}
$$

Using the formula for the area of oblique triangles, we see that, similarly, for any $\triangle{ABC}$,

$$
\text{area of } \triangle{ABC} = \frac12bc\sin{A} = \frac12ac\sin{b} = \frac12ab\sin{c}
$$

Dividing throughout by $\frac12abc$, we obtain the **sine rule**.

$$
\frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}
$$

This rule posits a relationship between each angle and its opposite side in a triangle.
## Ambiguous case
If two sides and a non-included angle of a triangle are given, an **ambiguous** case of the sine rule may occur. This will happen if
- the given angle is **acute**, and
- the side opposite the given angle is **smaller** than the other given side

If this occurs, there may be two possible solutions for the unknown triangle.

# Cosine rule
The **cosine rule** states that for any $\triangle ABC$,

$$
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= b^2 + c^2 -2bc\cos A \\[8pt]
\cos A &= \frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}
\end{align*}
$$

The cosine rule relates a particular side to the other two sides and the angle opposite itself.

It can be used to solve a triangle when **two sides** and **the included angle**, or **all three sides** are given.

# Bearings
The bearing of point $P$ from a reference point $O$ gives us the direction of $P$ from $O$. True bearings are always measured from the north and in the clockwise sense. A true bearing is always written as a **three-digit number** (excluding decimal places).

# Angles of elevation & depression
## Angle of elevation
An observer has to look at an angle above the horizontal in order to see an object **higher** than the observer.

The **angle of elevation** is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to an object above the horizontal.
    
## Angle of depression
Similarly, an observer must look at an angle below the horizontal in order to see an object **lower** than the observer.

The **angle of depression** is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight to an object below the horizontal.
