# Indices
In general, $a\times a\times a\times \cdots \text{n number of times} = a^n$.

This expression is said to be in **index form**, which contains two components — the **base** ($a$), and the **exponent** ($n$).

## Laws of indices
In general, if $a\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b \in\mathbb{R}$, and $m > 0$ and $n > 0$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
a^m \times a^n &= a^{m+n} \\[8pt]
a^m \div a^n &= a^{m-n} \\[8pt]
\left(a^m\right)^n &= a^{mn} \\[8pt]
a^n \times b^n &= \left(ab\right)^n \\[8pt]
a^n \div b^n &= \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n
\end{align*}
$$

if $a \in\mathbb{R}$ and $a \neq0$, then

$$
\begin{align*} a^0 &= 1 \\[8pt] a^{-n} &= \frac{1}{a^n} \end{align*}
$$

For positive integers $m$ and $n$,

$$
a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}
$$

# Surds
A **surd** is an **irrational number involving a root**.

Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b\neq0$ — these numbers cannot be represented as terminating or recurring decimals.

The $n^\text{th}$ root of $a$, $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$, is a surd if $a$ is not the perfect $n^\text{th}$ power of a rational number.

For positive number bases $a$ and $b$,

$$
\begin{gather*} \sqrt{a} \times\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab}\\[8pt] \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt\frac{a}{b} \end{gather*}
$$

## Simplification

$\sqrt{a}$ is said to be **simplified** if $a$ does not have any factor other than 1 that is a perfect square.

Suppose $a$ has a perfect square factor $k^2$ where $k\in\mathbb{R} \wedge k>1$. We may write $a = k^2 b$ for some integer $b>0$.

Hence, $\sqrt{a} = \sqrt{k^2b} = k\sqrt{b}$.

## Rationalisation
The product of two irrational numbers is not always an irrational number. In some cases, multiplying two irrational numbers may result in a rational number.

$a\sqrt{h} + b\sqrt{k}$ and $a\sqrt{h}-b\sqrt{k}$ are called **conjugate surds**.

$$
\left(a\sqrt{h}+b\sqrt{k}\right)\left(a\sqrt{h}-b\sqrt{k}\right) = \left(a\sqrt{h}\right)^2 - \left(b\sqrt{k}\right)^2 = a^2h - b^2k
$$

As shown, the product of conjugate surds is a rational number.

When a fraction has a surd in its denominator, the surd in the denominator is to be “eliminated” through rationalisation.

## Equality
Suppose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are rational numbers, and $\sqrt{k}$ is an irrational number.

If $a+b\sqrt{k} = c+d\sqrt{k}$, then $a=c$ and $b=d$.
