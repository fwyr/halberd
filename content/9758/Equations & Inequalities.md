# Inequalities
Inequalities ([[4049/Quadratic Functions & Inequalities#Inequalities|learnt previously]]) are mathematical expressions involving the symbols $>$, $<$, $\geq$, and $\leq$.
In solving an inequality like $f(x) > 0$, where $f(x)$ is an expression in $x$, we have to find a range of values for $x$ such that when substituted into $f(x)$, satisfies the given inequality.
## Properties of inequalities
The following properties are useful in solving inequalities:
- $a>b$ and $c> 0$ $\implies ac > bc$
- $a>b$ and $c< 0$ $\implies ac < bc$
- $\frac{a}{b}>0 \Leftrightarrow ab >0$
- $\frac{a}{b}<0\Leftrightarrow ab<0$
## Solving by quadratics
Factorisation, completing the square and applying the quadratic formula are important techniques that can help us to solve inequalities.
## Solving by polynomials
Solving inequalities involving polynomials depends largely on the behaviour of their graphs. 
In general, when sketching graphs of polynomial functions of the form $y=a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ to solve inequalities, we pay attention to the **roots** and the **tail ends** of the graph.
If the polynomial $a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+a_{n-2}x^{n-2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}$ has a repeated factor of the form $(x-k)^n$ where $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $m\geq2$, the graph has a stationary point at the $x$-intercept of $x=k$.
Paying attention to the power of the polynomial, $n$, and its coefficient, $a_n$,
- if $n$ is even and $a_n>0$, then the graph will go "up" on both ends
- if $n$ is even and $a_n < 0$, then the graph will go "down" on both ends
- if $n$ is odd and $a_n > 0$, then the graph will go "down" on the left and "up" on the right
- if $n$ is odd and $a_n < 0$, then the graph will go "up" on the left and "down" on the right
## Modulus inequalities
Some inequalities appear in conjunction with the modulus, or absolute value symbol $\mid~\mid$.
The absolute value of a real number $x$, denoted by $|x|$, is defined by
$$
|x| = \begin{cases}
x,& x\geq 0 \\
-x,& x< 0
\end{cases}
$$
Thus, 
$$
y=|f(x)| = \begin{cases}
f(x),& f(x)\geq 0 \\
-f(x), & f(x) < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Inequalities involving modulus have the following properties:
- $|x|< a \Leftrightarrow -a<x<a$
- $|x|> a \Leftrightarrow -a>x>a$
- $|x-a| < b \Leftrightarrow a-b<x<a+b$
- $|x-a|>b \Leftrightarrow x<a-b \text{ or } x>a+b$
